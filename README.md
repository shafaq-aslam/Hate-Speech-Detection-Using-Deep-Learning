## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required packages using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shafaq-aslam/Intelligent-Hate-Speech-Detection-Using-Bidirectional-LSTM.git
cd Hate-Speech-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
jupyter notebook <a href = "notebook.ipynb"> Notebook <a/>

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of labeled text data containing instances of hate speech and non-hate speech, sourced from various online platforms.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture typically includes:
<ul>
  <li>Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vector representations.</li>
  <li>LSTM/GRU Layers: Captures long-term dependencies in text data.</li>
  <li>Dense Layer: Outputs probabilities for each class (hate speech or not).</li>
</ul>

## Results
The model demonstrates high accuracy in detecting hate speech, providing valuable insights for moderating online content effectively.
